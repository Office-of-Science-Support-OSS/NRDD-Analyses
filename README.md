# NRDD-Analyses
Use this code to perform a variety of textual analyses using NRDD Data: 
## tf-idf
Term frequency-index document frequency (tf-idf) is a measurement of how relevant a term is to a document or a set of documents.
It is a common text mining tool used to pull out important search terms and can be used to summarize large documents. 

## multinomial naive bayes classification
Multinomial Naive Bayes is a supervised classification method/algorithm. It requires pre-labeled data associated with the content of the documents.
The associated dummy file for performing Naive Bayes is 'Fire and Heat Projects.xlsx'. Fill out the dummy file with your real data to perform classification with the R code.
